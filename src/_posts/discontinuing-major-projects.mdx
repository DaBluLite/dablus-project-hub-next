After 3 years, countless hours over an IDE, staring at a blank cursor, and a few thousand downloads, I decided to finally discontinue
my 2 largest projects (in terms of time spent on them, not overall engagement): Project Colorway (Colorish, DiscordColorways) and Cyan,
and at least to me, there are a few good reasons to do so.

## I kinda forgot I am a uni student
Yes, really. The main reason is to give more of my free time to studying, rather than trying to keep a theme working at all times,
 since Discord has gone on a redesigning spree these last few months. While that is the biggest reason for canceling Cyan, another one was:

## Lack of interest
At some point I had to come to the realization that people aren't all that interested in a global theming system, no matter
how versatile it became. Discontinuing colorways projects opens up space for me to work on new projects that would be more useful
in the long term.

Last but not least:

## Achieving goals
Cyan, in my opinion has achieved its original goal of creating a unique User Experience and design for Discord, while experimenting with
different design philosophies, and finally ending up how it is now, with Cyan 3.

DiscordColorways, on the other hand, has long achieved its original goal of offering a somewhat easy way of theming Discord with various
colors and gradients. Starting to add things on top of that (Colorway Themes, Managers/Colorish) should have been a sign to me from the very
beginning that I should stop.

## Where do I go from here
I honestly have no idea. Right now, I am working on giving Colorish a final version before sunsetting it, so that it can still work even with
no updates for me, by adding support for a new type of client, that will need no maintenance, just a simple implementation to inject it into a
website: Headless clients. Headless clients will be completely maintenance-free, by relying on Colorish to feed them precompiled colorways, using
any preset available in online and offline sources. This means that anyone will be able to make a simple colorways client for any website, and
anyone will be able to create presets for any website, publish them into their own sources, and use them in Colorish.

For now, I am leaving you with that, as well as the new design of my website.
